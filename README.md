AI Overview
Connecting Prisma to a PostgreSQL database and utilizing Prisma Studio involves several steps.
1. Setting up Prisma with PostgreSQL:
Install Prisma: In your project, install the Prisma CLI and Prisma Client:
Code

    npm install prisma @prisma/client
Initialize Prisma: Initialize Prisma in your project, which creates a prisma folder with a schema.prisma file:
Code

    npx prisma init
Configure Database Connection: In your schema.prisma file, specify PostgreSQL as the provider and set the DATABASE_URL environment variable to your PostgreSQL connection string. This string typically includes the database user, password, host, port, and database name.
Code

    // prisma/schema.prisma
    datasource db {
      provider = "postgresql"
      url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }
Define Your Schema:
Define your database models in the schema.prisma file using Prisma's schema language.
Run Migrations:
Apply your schema changes to the database by generating and running migrations:
Code

    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
Generate Prisma Client: Generate the Prisma Client, which is a type-safe query builder for your database:
Code

    npx prisma generate
2. Using Prisma Studio:
Prisma Studio is a visual interface for interacting with your database.
Launch Prisma Studio: Open Prisma Studio from your terminal:
Code

    npx prisma studio
